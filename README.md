# Note

- 1.Garden linux that support Direct Network configured and rootf save to tar archive.This should be worked with [Diego](https://github.com/guanglinlv/diego-release/tree/DNetAndRootFSSave)
- 2.Support Centos 7.

# Garden Linux

A Linux backend for [Garden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden).

You can deploy Garden (inside a Garden container) using the [Garden BOSH Release repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release).

See the [old README](old/README.md) for old documentation, caveat lector.

## Installing Garden-Linux

**Note:** the rest of these instructions assume you arranged for the garden-linux code, and dependencies, to be
installed in your `$GOPATH` inside a linux environment, either by following the steps above or through some other mechanism.

The rest of these instructions assume you are running inside an Ubuntu environment (for example, the above vagrant box) with go installed and the code checked out.

* Build garden-linux

        cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux # assuming your $GOPATH has only one entry
        make
        go build -a -tags daemon -o out/garden-linux

* Set up necessary directories

        sudo mkdir -p /opt/garden/containers
        sudo mkdir -p /opt/garden/snapshots
        sudo mkdir -p /opt/garden/overlays
        sudo mkdir -p /opt/garden/rootfs

* (Optional) Set up a RootFS

    If you plan to run docker images instead of using the warden rootfs provider, you can skip this step.

    Follow the instructions at [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks) to generate a rootfs, or download one from `http://cf-runtime-stacks.s3.amazonaws.com/lucid64.dev.tgz`. Extract it to `/opt/warden/rootfs` (or pass a different directory in the next step).

        wget http://cf-runtime-stacks.s3.amazonaws.com/lucid64.dev.tgz
        sudo tar -xzpf lucid64.dev.tgz -C /opt/garden/rootfs

* Run garden-linux

        cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux # assuming your $GOPATH has only one entry
        sudo ./out/garden-linux \
               -depot=/opt/garden/containers \
               -bin=$PWD/old/linux_backend/bin \
               -rootfs=/opt/garden/rootfs \
               -snapshots=/opt/garden/snapshots \
               -overlays=/opt/garden/overlays \
               -listenNetwork=tcp \
               -listenAddr=127.0.0.1:7777 \
               "$@"

* Kick the tyres

    The external API is exposed using [Garden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden), the instructions at that repo document the various API calls that you can now make (it will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:7777` if you followed the above instructions).

## External API

The `garden-linux` executable provides a server which clients can use to perform operations on Garden Linux,
such as creating containers and running processes inside containers.
    
Garden Linux is configured by passing command line flags to the `garden-linux` executable.

[Garden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden) defines the protocol supported by the server and provides a Go API for programmatic access.

## Development

Restructure in progress: code in the `old/` directory is being replaced with code elsewhere in the repository.

See the [Developer's Guide](docs/DEVELOPING.md) to get started.
